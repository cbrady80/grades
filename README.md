# Overview

This is a simple program to demonstrate basic syntax and functions in Java including
variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and data structures
from Java Collection Frameworks.

It prompts a student user to input any number of percentage grades, computes an average,
then uses that average to determine the letter grade, and displays that grade 
to the student.

I wrote this software to help myself and others learning Java to better understand the basics.

# Development Environment

The tools used were:
* JDK from Oracle
* IntelliJ
* Git/GitHub

The programming language used was Java.
* I imported the java.util.* package which enabled me to use the Scanner class for inputs, 
 and the ArrayList to store the inputs and process them.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* Add in a Student Object to be able to create and save user information.
* Add in a way to save information to a file or a cloud.
* Link to a web interface.
